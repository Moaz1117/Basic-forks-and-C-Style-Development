Theoretical Answers:

- Write the code examples you have seen in Lab-5. Explain each one
and what it does?

Ex1: 
This program demonstrates process creation using the fork() system call in Linux, When the program reaches fork(), the operating system makes a copy of the running program. Now you have two processes: a parent and a child.
In the child process, fork() returns 0 and in the parent process, fork() returns the child’s PID. And then the system prints both with their respectful pids.

Ex2:
The & Operator in Linux when used in the end of the statement runs the process in the background and jobs lists running background processes.

Ex3:
ps aux lists all running processes in the system and the | operator does pipeleing so you can use the output of your first command as an input to your second and grep searches for a specific word.
kill stops a process.

Ex4:
Kill -STOP pauses a process and kill -CONT contiues it.

Ex5:
gcc file1.c file2.c -o output_program compiles the both files and links them putting both in a single file output_program.
./output_program runs the program.

Ex6:
ldd simple_program shows the shared libraries that the executable is linked to at build time.


-What is the job of a Linker?
The linkers job is to combine compiled code and libraries into a one working executable to resolve all references between them.

-What is the job of a Loader?
The loaders job is to take an executable from disk, put it in memory and start it running.
